The goal of this application is to teach myself how to use the HTML canvas element, and to use javascript to make an interesting application. 

## Kvadrug background

"Atypography is an art movement that graphically represents traditional writing systems in an unconventional way, creating an authentic design that remains readable while concealing text signs at first glance." - [Atypography Manual](https://www.atypography.com/manual). The goal is to combine abstraction with typography.

The font I am using is called Kvadrug Hikikomori. The square represents the basis of the letter, and the circles inside it represent the cavities. The font was created by Svethe Grudi (I believe), and can be found [here](https://www.atypography.com/product-page/kvadrug-hikikomori). Here is the character set:
